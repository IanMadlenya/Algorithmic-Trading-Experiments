# Algorithmic Trading Projects
repo for holding projects related to algorithmic trading. right now, just has 
"Don't Feed The Birds", which is a medium frequency trading algorithm that
uses LingPipe to perform sentiment analysis on a sample of real time data
from the Twitter API. Then makes a decision on whether the public sentiment 
is overall positive or negative. Ideally, this can inform medium-frequency 
(i.e. - daily) stock trading strategies. 
Mostly an experiment to see if this kind of strategy is viable.
